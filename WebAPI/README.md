## Linking the project to PostMan
This is for the WebAPI folder. This is where you will run the command --> dotnet run --project WebAPI <--
After this it will build the project for you which will then allow you to be able to use your controllers.
To link this to postman you will need to copy your httplocalhost which will show up when the project is ran. You will then put that in the variable slot as your base url. This will link the two so that postman will know where it is drawing the infromation from. ![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-06-22 141131.png>)

## How the controllers work
Once your server is up and running feel free to go to post man and create your requests.
Each individual controller will allow you to be able to make different requests.
To create a request in postman you will follow the controllers (http) requests  an the link to that function to be able to create and pull that information once created. The post man resuest will look like this ![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-06-22 144019.png>) 
and these are the requests that you want to put in after the baseUrl.

## General information on "TheWalkingDog"
In the main README.md we have provided you with a picture showing the process in which you should create these requests. There will be two versions of a User. One will be the actual User which will be able to request a walk from the dog walker. After this is done the walker will be able to start the walk and you will be able to keep track of the walk.
